# Handmade Hero - A *handmade* Windows game in C and C++
This is my personal interpretation of Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero project, feel free to use or contribute!

## Code
The code is updated as I follow the videos from the series, sometimes I will add stuff by myself or do things differently from Casey (mainly to learn and experiment, or because I follow different code practices than him)
## Notes
I am going to add some notes as I follow through the series, feel free to use them for your personal study, or even contribute and add useful contents for the community!
