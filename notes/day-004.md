### Handmade Hero Day 004 - Animating a backbuffer

To animate the backbuffer allocated in Day 003, the function RenderToWindow was created. It takes an XY offset and renders to the window.
It is important to remember that in Windows the RGB bits are allocated in register as:

    0xXXRRGGBB       (B=Blue; G=Green; R=Red; X=Padding)

But in memory as:

    0xBBGGRRXX      (B=Blue; G=Green; R=Red; X=Padding)

This was because it was easier for Windows Devs to read it as XRGB in register, but that means the values are being mirrored in memory.
```cpp
static void RenderToWindow(int XOffset, int YOffset)
{
    int Width  = BitmapWidth;
    int Height = BitmapHeight;

    int Pitch = Width * BytesPerPixel;
    uint8_t *Row = (uint8_t *)BitmapMemory;

    for (int Y = 0; Y < BitmapHeight; ++Y)
    {
        uint32_t *Pixel = (uint32_t *)Row;
        for (int X = 0; X < BitmapWidth; ++X)
        {
            uint8_t Red = 128;
            uint8_t Blue = X + XOffset;
            uint8_t Green = Y + YOffset;

            *Pixel++ = Red << 16 | Green << 8 | Blue;
        }
        Row += Pitch;
    }
}
```

And to manage all the incoming messages we used WindowHandle and a Message variable. The actual code is temporary, but it was useful to see how we can Blt the Bitmap:
```cpp
if (WindowHandle != NULL)
{
    Running = true;
    int XOffset = 0;
    int YOffset = 0;

    while(Running)
    {
        MSG Message;

        while (PeekMessageA(&Message, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
        {
            if (Message.message == WM_QUIT) Running = false;

            TranslateMessage(&Message);
            DispatchMessage(&Message);

            RenderToWindow(XOffset, YOffset);

            HDC DeviceContext = GetDC(WindowHandle);
            RECT ClientRect;
            GetClientRect(WindowHandle, &ClientRect);
            int WindowWidth = ClientRect.right - ClientRect.left;
            int WindowHeight = ClientRect.bottom - ClientRect.top;
            WindowUpdate(DeviceContext, &ClientRect, WindowWidth, WindowHeight);
            ReleaseDC(WindowHandle, DeviceContext);

            XOffset++;
            YOffset++;
        }
    }
}
```
