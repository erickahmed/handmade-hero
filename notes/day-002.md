### Handmade Hero Day 002 - Opening a Win32 Window
First step was to open a simple window using the Windows API built in functions:

WinMain is the user-provided entry point for a graphical Windows-based application.
WinMain is the conventional name used for the application entry point.

```cpp
int WINAPI WinMain(
    HINSTANCE   Instance,
    HINSTANCE   PrevInstance,
    LPSTR       CmdLine,
    int         ShowCode
    )
```

We used WNDCLASSEXA which contains window class information. It is used with the RegisterClassEx and GetClassInfoEx  functions.

The WNDCLASSEX structure is similar to the WNDCLASS structure. There are two differences. WNDCLASSEX includes the cbSize member, which specifies the size of the structure, and the hIconSm member, which contains a handle to a small icon associated with the window class.
```cpp
WNDCLASSEXA WindowClass = {};

    WindowClass.cbSize = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
    WindowClass.style = CS_OWNDC | CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW;
    WindowClass.lpfnWndProc = WndCallback;
    WindowClass.hInstance = Instance;
    WindowClass.hIcon = NULL;
    WindowClass.lpszMenuName = "Handmade Hero";
    WindowClass.lpszClassName = "HandmadeHeroWindowClass";

    if (RegisterClassExA(&WindowClass))
    {
        HWND WindowHandle = CreateWindowExA(
            0,
            WindowClass.lpszClassName,
            WindowClass.lpszMenuName,
            WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW|WS_VISIBLE,
            CW_USEDEFAULT,
            CW_USEDEFAULT,
            CW_USEDEFAULT,
            CW_USEDEFAULT,
            0,
            0,
            Instance,
            0
            );
    }
```

Then was the time to set the debug messages that Windows internally manages, useful for debugging with Visual Studio and to manage the closing, destruction or drawing of the window:
```cpp
switch (Message)
{
case WM_SIZE:
    Win32ResizeDIBSection(ClientWidth, ClientHeight);
    break;

case WM_DESTROY:
    Running = false;
    DestroyWindow(Window);
    break;

case WM_CLOSE:
    Running = false;
    PostQuitMessage(0);
    break;

case WM_ACTIVATEAPP:
    //
    break;

case WM_PAINT:
{
    PAINTSTRUCT Paint;

    HDC DeviceContext = BeginPaint(Window, &Paint);

    int X = Paint.rcPaint.left;
    int Y = Paint.rcPaint.top;
    int Height = Paint.rcPaint.bottom - Paint.rcPaint.top;
    int Width  = Paint.rcPaint.right  - Paint.rcPaint.left;

    RECT ClientRect;
    GetClientRect(Window, &ClientRect);

    WindowUpdate(DeviceContext, &ClientRect, Width, Height);

    EndPaint(Window, &Paint);

    Result = 0;
    break;
}

default:
    Result = DefWindowProcA(Window, Message, WParam, LParam);
    break;
}
return(Result);
```
We ended up with a working (kind of) window that opens and closes and can even be black or white!
